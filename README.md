# Ovyerus' dotfiles

[NixOS](https://nixos.org), [nix-darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin),
and [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) configurations
for my various personal machines and servers.

These configurations are not intended to be used verbatim for anyone else's
usage, and instead are provided as real world examples of daily driver Nix
configurations. But there's nothing stopping you if you really want to do that.

NixOS and nix-darwin entrypoints are in [./flake.nix](./flake.nix).
